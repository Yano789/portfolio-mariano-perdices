## Overview
Developed a predictive model analyzing 20+ indicators from World Bank, FAO and Economist Impact datasets to forecast Food Security Index (FSI) scores. The model helps identify high-risk regions and evaluate policy effectiveness.

## Key Features
- **Multi-Source Data Integration:** Combined economic (GDP, inflation), agricultural (land use, yields) and health (HDI, stunting) indicators
- **Model Benchmarking:** Tested 3 regression approaches:
  - Economic-only model (R² = 0.712)
  - Agricultural-economic model (R² = 0.791)
  - Full health-social model (R² = 0.843)
- **Policy Dashboard:** Interactive visualization of key drivers by region

## Technologies Used
- **Python:** pandas for cleaning, scikit-learn for modeling
- **Statistical Analysis:** Polynomial regression, cross-validation
- **Visualization:** Plotly for interactive charts, matplotlib for static reports

## Challenges and Learnings
- **Data Gaps:** Developed custom imputation strategy for missing agricultural data
- **Interpretability:** Created simplified decision trees for non-technical stakeholders
- **Scale:** Optimized runtime for global dataset (187 countries, 20-year span)

## Outcome
The model achieved 84.3% accuracy in predicting FSI scores and identified:
1. HDI as strongest single predictor
2. Non-linear relationship between agricultural spending and food security
3. Regional variations in key drivers
